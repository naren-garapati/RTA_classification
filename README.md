# Road Traffic Accident Classification
## Road traffic accident severity classification ML model trained on a dataset from Ethiopia

You can find a jupyter notebook where I explore a traffic accident data and try to predict the severity of a given accident. In it, you can see my machine learning workflows, including advanced EDA and thought processes during data manipulation and model training. 

The end goal was to deploy the model in a streamlit app where users can interact with various features to predict the severity of an accident given the feature inputs.
